// The project completed in spring of 2021 involved taking a history of global temperature data recorded from roughly 1700 to modern day and performing regressions on the data in order to find a line of best fit that could be used to predict or extrapolate future global temperatures in different areas. The project itself is too large to upload to github with my current license as the .csv files are easily over 100mb, so if you would like to see it or receive the project, email my at john_sbur@yahoo.com for details.
